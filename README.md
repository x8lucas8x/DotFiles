# Dot Files

Configuration files for editors and other UNIX tools.
These make it easier for me to setup a programming environment.
They include things, such as:

- neovim
- starship
- kitty
- zellij
- yazi
- zoxide
- fzf
- lazygit
- Nerd fonts
- zsh

## How to run

On Mac:
```bash
 chmod +x install-mac.sh
 ./install-mac.sh
 ```

On arch-based distro:
```bash
 chmod +x install-arch.sh
 ./install-arch.sh
 ```

## Extras

On the *nonStow* folder there are also other files, which are meant
be reused without GNU stow (e.g., kde exports). Just in case the
stow folders does not work after say an upgrade.
